# Python-App-Posture-Reminder

This is a Windows App I built with Python and the Tkinter GUI library. The purpose of this app is to remind the user to correct their posture while sitting in front of the computer. 

After lauching the app, the user will have 4 reminder options - every 15 mins/30 mins, every hour/2 hours. The app will minimize after selecting one of the options and will pop back up and make a sound to reminder the user to check his/her posture. After which, one of the 4 timing options needs to be selected again. 

I built this app to practice writing Python code and to learn the Tkinter library. 

Make sure to launch the app from the same directory as the rest of the files contained within the final folder.
