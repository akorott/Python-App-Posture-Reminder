# Python-App-Posture-Reminder

This is an App I built with Python and the Tkinter GUI library. The purpose of this app is to remind the user to correct their posture while sitting in front of the computer. 

The app was packaged with PyInstaller. 

After lauching the app, the user will have 4 reminder options - every 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour, 2 hours. The app will minimize after selecting one of the options and will pop back up and make a sound to reminder the user to check his/her posture. After it pops back up, one of the 4 timing options needs to be selected again. 

This app was built solely to practice creating a GUI with Tkinter. 

To use this app - download the zip folder and run the .exe file within it. Make sure the rest of the files are in the same folder as the .exe file.
